        <h1>Agentic Code Review</h1>
<p>This repo holds the source code for a team of AI agents that spring into action and perform a code review each time a <strong>.py</strong> or <strong>.js</strong> file in the "source" directory is changed or added. One agent is an expert in code security. Another is an expert in debugging, and a third is an expert in code optimization. A lead agent examines each source-code file and hands them off to the other agents. Check out <strong>handle_changed_files.py</strong> in the "scripts" directory to see the source code.</p>
<p>To see these agents in action:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create a GitHub repo and copy these files into it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a GitHub secret named API_KEY and set it equal to your OpenAI API key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check a <strong>.py</strong> or <strong>.js</strong> file into the "source" directory (or change an existing one).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait a moment for the agents to run. The look in the "reports" directory for an MD file containing a code review.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After adding or changing a file, you can open the repo in your browser and navigate to the "Actions" tab to see the script run in real time. <strong>handle_changed_files.py</strong> is triggered by a GitHub action.</p>
