Below is the aggregated report from our Code Security, Code Debugging, and Code Optimization Agents. In summary, while the source code implements the intended functionality with Flask routes and streaming responses, our team identified several issues that need addressing. The security review focused on preventing sensitive data exposure, input sanitization and safe session handling; the debugging review spotlighted potential HTTP method casing problems, function scope and initialization issues (especially regarding session IDs in exceptions), and concurrency vulnerabilities in file handling; and the optimization review highlighted opportunities to streamline header settings, code formatting, and overall structure for better maintainability. The following sections provide detailed recommendations and before‐and‐after code snippets for each focus area.

---

## Security Recommendations

1. **Avoid Exposing Internal Error Details**  
   *Issue:* Exception messages are returned directly to the client, possibly leaking sensitive information.  
   *Before:*
   ```python
   except Exception as e:
       output = f"I'm sorry, but something went wrong. ({str(e)})"
       response = make_response(stream_with_context(generate(output)))
       response.headers['X-Session-ID'] = session_id
       return response
   ```
   *After:*
   ```python
   import logging
   logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

   except Exception as e:
       logger.error("Error in /team endpoint", exc_info=True)
       output = "I'm sorry, but something went wrong."
       response = make_response(stream_with_context(generate(output)))
       response.headers['X-Session-ID'] = session_id
       return response
   ```

2. **Validate and Sanitize User Input**  
   *Issue:* Unsanitized user input can result in injection attacks.  
   *Before:*
   ```python
   user_input = request.args.get('input')
   output = team.run(user_input, stream=True)
   ```
   *After (simple regex-based validation):*
   ```python
   import re

   user_input = request.args.get('input')
   if not user_input or not re.match("^[a-zA-Z0-9 .,?!]+$", user_input):
       return Response("Invalid input", status=400)
   output = team.run(user_input, stream=True)
   ```

3. **Secure Session ID Handling**  
   *Issue:* Allowing clients to provide their own session IDs may lead to session fixation.  
   *Before:*
   ```python
   session_id = request.headers.get('X-Session-ID')
   if not session_id:
       session_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
   team.session_id = session_id
   ```
   *After (always generating a new session ID or validating input):*
   ```python
   import re

   # Option 1: Always generate a new session ID
   session_id = str(uuid.uuid4())

   # Option 2: Validate incoming session ID
   session_id = request.headers.get('X-Session-ID')
   if session_id and not re.match(r'^[a-f0-9\-]+$', session_id):
       session_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
   elif not session_id:
       session_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
   team.session_id = session_id
   ```

4. **Use Appropriate HTTP Methods**  
   *Issue:* The `/team` endpoint uses GET while performing actions that should be non-idempotent.  
   *Before:*
   ```python
   @app.route('/team', methods=['get'])
   def ask_team():
       ...
   ```
   *After (changing to POST):*
   ```python
   @app.route('/team', methods=['POST'])
   def ask_team():
       user_input = request.form.get('input')  # or JSON as appropriate
       ...
   ```

5. **Protect Image File Endpoint Against Race Conditions**  
   *Issue:* Concurrent access to the image file may lead to race conditions during file deletion.  
   *Before:*
   ```python
   if os.path.exists(IMAGE_PATH):
       with open(IMAGE_PATH, 'rb') as image_file:
           image_bytes = image_file.read()
       base64_image = base64.b64encode(image_bytes).decode('utf-8')
       src = f'data:image/png;base64,{base64_image}'
       os.remove(IMAGE_PATH)
   ```
   *After (using try/finally and logging):*
   ```python
   if os.path.exists(IMAGE_PATH):
       try:
           with open(IMAGE_PATH, 'rb') as image_file:
               image_bytes = image_file.read()
           base64_image = base64.b64encode(image_bytes).decode('utf-8')
           src = f'data:image/png;base64,{base64_image}'
       finally:
           try:
               os.remove(IMAGE_PATH)
           except Exception as rm_err:
               logger.error("Error removing image file", exc_info=True)
   ```

## Debugging Recommendations

1. **HTTP Method Casing**  
   *Issue:* HTTP method names should be uppercase for clarity and consistency.  
   *Before:*
   ```python
   @app.route('/team', methods=['get'])
   ```
   *After:*
   ```python
   @app.route('/team', methods=['GET'])
   ```

2. **Indentation and Function Scope**  
   *Issue:* Ensure helper functions are defined at the proper scope.  
   *Before:*
   ```python
   # REST method for invoking a team of agents
   @app.route('/team', methods=['GET'])
   def ask_team():
       try:
           ...
       except Exception as e:
           ...
       
   # Generator for streaming output
    def generate(chunks):
        for chunk in chunks:
            yield chunk.content
   ```
   *After:*
   ```python
   @app.route('/team', methods=['GET'])
   def ask_team():
       try:
           ...
       except Exception as e:
           ...
   
   def generate(chunks):
       for chunk in chunks:
           yield chunk.content
   ```

3. **Exception Handling and Session ID Initialization**  
   *Issue:* If an error occurs before `session_id` is defined, further exceptions may be raised.  
   *Before:*
   ```python
   @app.route('/team', methods=['GET'])
   def ask_team():
       try:
           session_id = request.headers.get('X-Session-ID')
           if not session_id:
               session_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
           ...
       except Exception as e:
           output = f"I'm sorry, but something went wrong. ({str(e)})"
           response = make_response(stream_with_context(generate(output)))
           response.headers['X-Session-ID'] = session_id
           return response
   ```
   *After:*
   ```python
   @app.route('/team', methods=['GET'])
   def ask_team():
       session_id = request.headers.get('X-Session-ID') or str(uuid.uuid4())
       try:
           team = create_team(_memory)
           team.session_id = session_id
           user_input = request.args.get('input')
           if user_input is None:
               raise ValueError("Missing user input.")
           output = team.run(user_input, stream=True)
           response = make_response(stream_with_context(generate(output)))
       except Exception as e:
           app.logger.error("Error in ask_team: %s", e)
           error_output = "An error occurred, please try again later."
           response = make_response(stream_with_context(generate([DummyChunk(error_output)])))
           response.status_code = 500
       finally:
           response.headers['X-Session-ID'] = session_id
       return response

   # DummyChunk class to wrap error messages
   class DummyChunk:
       def __init__(self, content):
           self.content = content
   ```

---

## Optimization Recommendations

1. **Simplify HTTP Header Setting**  
   *Issue:* Repeated header settings can be centralized.  
   *Optimization:* Use a `finally` clause to set headers or wrap common header logic into a helper function.

2. **Improve Code Format and Consistency**  
   *Issue:* Correcting spacing and indentation improves readability.  
   *Before:*
   ```python
   # Generator for streaming output
    def generate(chunks):
        for chunk in chunks:
            yield chunk.content
   ```
   *After:*
   ```python
   def generate(chunks):
       for chunk in chunks:
           yield chunk.content
   ```

3. **Reorganize Code for Maintainability**  
   *Issue:* Separating concerns (helper functions, route handlers) can make future changes easier.  
   *Recommendation:* Consider placing logging, input validation, and file handling utilities in separate modules. Also, use Flask’s built-in methods like jsonify for structured responses where applicable.

4. **Consistent HTTP Method Naming**  
   *Issue:* While functional, consistent upper-case usage improves code clarity.  
   *Before:*
   ```python
   @app.route('/team', methods=['get'])
   ```
   *After:*
   ```python
   @app.route('/team', methods=['GET'])
   ```
